# Detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph-GFG-

Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.



Example 1:

Input:



Output: 1


Explanation: 3 -> 3 is a cycle

Input:


Output: 0


Explanation: no cycle in the graph



Your task:
You don’t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isCyclic() which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and adjacency list as input parameters and returns a boolean value denoting if the given directed graph contains a cycle or not.



Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)


Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V)


Constraints:


1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105
